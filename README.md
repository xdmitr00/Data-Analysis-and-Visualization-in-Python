# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-in-Python

# Overview

This project focuses on data processing and visualization tasks using Python. It includes implementations for numerical integration, graph generation, advanced sinusoidal signal visualization, and web scraping to download meteorological station data.

## Tasks

### 1. Numerical Integration

Implement the `integrate` function for numerical integration using the rectangle method.
- **Input:** Compatible NumPy function, interval bounds (a and b), and an optional number of steps.
- **Output:** Value of the definite integral calculated using the specified method.

### 2. Graph Generation with Different Coefficients

Implement the `generate_graph` function to visualize a specific mathematical function with different coefficients.
- **Input:** List of coefficients, boolean to show the figure, and an optional path for saving the figure.
- **Output:** Graphs displaying functions and calculated integrals.

### 3. Advanced Sinusoidal Signal Visualization

Implement the `generate_sinus` function to create a graph with three subplots for sinusoidal functions.
- **Output:** Graph with highlighted regions and customizable appearance.

### 4. Web Scraping for Meteorological Station Data

Implement the `download_data` function to scrape meteorological station data from a specific URL.
- **Output:** List of dictionaries containing information for each station.
